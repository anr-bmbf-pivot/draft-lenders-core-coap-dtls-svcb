1.  Introduction

   Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) allows agreeing on an
   application-layer protocol during a Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   handshake.  For that an ALPN ID is used.  Furthermore, the ALPN ID
   can be used to discover Service Bindings (SVCB) via DNS, using SVCB
   resource records with the "alpn" Service Parameter Keys.  As an
   example, this information can be obtained as part of the discovery of
   DNS over CoAP (DoC) servers (see [I-D.ietf-core-dns-over-coap]) that
   deploy TLS or DTLS to secure their messages.  This document specifies
   ALPN IDs for CoAP services that are secured by transport security,
   namely TLS and DTLS.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) IDs

   For CoAP over TLS an ALPN ID was defined in [RFC8323].  As it is not
   advisable to re-use the same ALPN ID for a different transport layer,
   an ALPN for CoAP over DTLS is also registered in Section 5.

   ALPN ID values have no fixed length.  A short value ("co") is
   allocated for CoAP over DTLS.  This avoids fragmentation of Client
   Hello and Server Hello messages in constrained networks with link-
   layer fragmentation, such as 6LoWPAN [RFC4944].

   To discover CoAP services that secure their messages with TLS or
   DTLS, these ALPN IDs can be used in the same manner as for any other
   service secured with transport layer security, as described in
   [RFC9460].  Other authentication mechanisms are currently out of
   scope.

4.  Security Considerations

   Any security considerations on ALPN (see [RFC7301]) and SVCB resource
   records (see [RFC9460]), also apply to this document.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  TLS ALPN for CoAP

   The following entry has been added to the "TLS Application-Layer
   Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" registry, which is part of
   the "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions" group.

   *  Protocol: CoAP (over DTLS)

   *  Identification sequence: 0x63 0x6f ("co")

   *  Reference: [RFC7252] and [this document]

   Note that [RFC7252] does not define the use of the ALPN TLS extension
   during connection the DTLS handshake.  This document does not change
   that, and thus does not establish any rules like those in Section 8.2
   of [RFC8323].
